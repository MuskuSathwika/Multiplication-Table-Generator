# Multiplication-Table-Generatorhttps://github.com/MuskuSathwika/Multiplication-Table-Generator/blob/main/README.md
This Java program generates multiplication tables for a given range of numbers. The user provides a starting point, ending point, and the range (till which each table should be printed). The program then prints all multiplication tables neatly formatted.

Lets the user decide how far each table should go (e.g., up to 10, 15, 20, etc.).

Uses nested for-loops to demonstrate control flow in Java.

Clean and formatted output for better readability.
